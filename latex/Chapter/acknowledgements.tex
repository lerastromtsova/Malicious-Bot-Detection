\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I want to express my gratitude to my supervisor from the University of Passau, Isabella Gra√ül, who provided invaluable feedback and assisted me in every possible way to ensure my success with the thesis. Isabella's professional advice helped me find the right means to conduct this study, and her friendly attitude was always a source of inspiration and optimism.

I could not have undertaken this journey without my husband Vitalii, who always believes in my success and does not cease to see the best in me. He is my greatest emotional support in these uncertain times. I am grateful to this wonderful person for always being there for me and teaching me perseverance, honesty and determination, without which any kind of scientific research would be meaningless and futile.
