** Thesis Document Structure ** 


"thesis.tex" is the main LaTeX document. 
Do not modify the style, the title page or any other format of the template. 

It includes some "input" files based on the chapter structure of the thesis. You can add as many additional chapters as you need. 

Also feel free to add any LaTeX package necessary for your thesis. 

User Biber for literature references instead of bibtex. 

To compile your thesis use pdflatex and biber: 

pdflatex thesis.tex
biber thesis.bcf
pdflatex thesis.tex


If you want to write your thesis in German, than delete all occurence of "english" in thesis.tex to use a German "Contents" / "Inhaltsverzeichnis" and document structure. Also adjust "finalthesis.sty" to the "German" content.
